# yaDrone-Recorder-2
<p>
**Control the AR.Drone 2.0 with keyboard, record flight data.**
<p>
The flight data that are recorded in the format of comma separated values
can be visualised using my application [Drone Flight Inspector](https://github.com/Formicarufa/DroneFlightInspector).
<p>
yaDrone-Recorder-2 extends and replaces the [yaDrone-Recorder](https://github.com/Formicarufa/YADrone-Recorder) project, 
a fork of the [yaDrone library](https://github.com/MahatmaX/YADrone).
##Changes compared to the previous version
[The Netbeans Platform](https://netbeans.org/features/platform/) window system is used instead of the original Swing JDesktopPane, 
which makes the application more user-friendly. In addition to that, the recorder plugin can now **record flight data 
automatically** and a new plugin that shows the current **orientation of the drone in 3D** has been created.
